            <hr class="lin mx-auto text-start" />
            <p>
              Intellect Africa seeks to serve as information gateway to high
              school students in Africa. Before the conception of this project,
              I realized how difficult getting the right information might be.
              Thanks to Tioluwanimofe Adesanya who had worked together with me
              on the project.
              <br />
              Since 2006, the US consulate in Nigeria have been accepting
              students in the country into the Opportunity Funds Program to
              assist low income and high achieving students fufil their dream of
              studying in the United States. However, many low income student
              with brilliant abilities are ignorant about the opportunity.
              <br />
              I was privileged to be accepted into the program in 2020 as an
              undergraduate scholar. Although this was a great opportunity, I
              wasn't prepared for it. Applying to the United States requires
              having a list of active participation in extracurriculars apart
              from your academic standing. Being a student from a sub-urban
              center in Southern Abeokuta, Ideal Comprehensive College, leaves
              me with merger information on extracurriculars I could participate
              in outside of my school. The journey of applying to the US brought
              unexhaustive list of extracurriculars I could participate in while
              at home and why they are important. It is one thing to know you
              can do this and it is another to know why you're doing it. Thanks
              to the supportive
              <a href="https://educationusanigeria.org/">EducationUSA Lagos</a>
              community all the way. <br />
              I look forward to a growing community of scholars at Intellect
              Africa.

                <p style="font-family: 'Fuzzy Bubbles', cursive">
                  John Adeyemo is a student who through curiosity have been able
                  to explore opportunities around him. He was the valedictorian
                  of the class of 2020 at Ideal Comprehensive College where he
                  attended for his secondary education and the Senior prefect.
                  During his time as a student he represented the school at a
                  number of competitions including Abayomi Jiboku Foundation
                  Chemistry Competition 2019, SG Holding Quiz Competition
                  '20-2021, among others. He emerged as one of the last six man
                  standing for the final stage of the SG TV quiz in Ogun state.
                  However, he couldn't find a place in the top three positions.
                  <br />
                  In July 2020, John was conditionally selected as an
                  Opportunity Funds Program scholar where he received guidance
                  on applying to schools in the United States. This opportunity
                  helped John further enhance himself by taking courses on
                  Coursera ranging from Calculus to Web development and
                  Cybersecurity. In recent times, John has found his interest in
                  cybersecurity becoming stronger. He longs to research on
                  software security in College. With love, John remain forever
                  grateful to his brother Peter, who ensured he applied for the
                  Opportunity Funds Program back in 2020. John continually look
                  for ways to give back to his community, that’s why he embarked
                  on the Intellect Africa journey with his friend, Mofe. <br />
                  John hopes one day, his dream of studying in the United States
                  will be a reality.

                  Tioluwanimofe Adesanya, a software engineer, content creator,
                  and editor all by profession is a high school graduate from
                  Landmark University Secondary School. From a family of five.
                  This young entrepreneur has edited many articles including,
                  The Four Personalities of an individual, Smart Talks with
                  Mofe, and Amy’s dream all of which have been recognized on
                  various cross-editing platforms. <br />
                  <b>His Career:</b> Growing up in the megacity of Lagos State
                  took into content creation at the age of fourteen. Where he
                  marketed and showcased his natural talents by working under
                  Reaps ventures. At the age of sixteen, he once again
                  challenged his entrepreneurial skills by delving into the
                  world of Information Technology with the aspirations of
                  becoming the world’s most remarkable software engineer with an
                  African background. Up till this date, Tioluwanimofe has taken
                  this dream of his by the neck, seizing every moment to develop
                  himself as well as his community.

                  <b>His Hobbies:</b> Being a Choleric Sanguine by personality,
                  Tioluwanimofe, has been using this special personality to
                  impact those around him, be it by vocally spreading the news
                  of opportunities to those around him, or organizing training
                  to shorten the gap between Technological illiteracy in an
                  African home. In a personal interview, he once said he always
                  felt his God-given calling was to break the Technological
                  barrier in his home country thus earning him the nickname
                  Techno-king.

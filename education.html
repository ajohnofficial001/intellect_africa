One of the largest foundations in the world, it works almost exclusively in Africa. It was created in 2006 by Mastercard International and operates independently under the governance of its own Board of Directors.
                Our focus is helping economically disadvantaged young people in Africa to find opportunities to move themselves, their families, and their communities out of poverty to a better life.
                To advance education and financial inclusion to catalyze prosperity in developing countries and Africa at large.
                The Mastercard Foundation seeks a world where all have the opportunity to learn and prosper.
                All people, no matter where their starting point in life, should have an equal chance to succeed. We believe that with access to education, financial services, and skills training, people can have that chance.

                    <p class="card-text">African Leadership Academy seeks to transform Africa by developing a powerful network of young leaders who will work together to address Africa’s greatest challenges, achieve extraordinary social impact, and accelerate the continent’s growth trajectory.
                      <h6>Here is what ALA have to say:</h6>
                      Africa’s greatest need is ethical and entrepreneurial leadership. 
                      Too often, we only invest in addressing the symptoms of poor leadership in Africa: we give blankets, food, and medicine to those impacted by war, poverty, and famine. 
                      But these efforts will never stop unless we develop leaders who prevent wars, entrepreneurs who create jobs, and innovators that develop lasting solutions to the root causes of Africa’s problems. We aim to develop the future Nelson Mandela, the next Wangari Maathai, and the African Bill Gates. <br>
                      <b>Our Model: Identify Potential </b>
                      We comb Africa for youth who show the spark of initiative; who see what can be and strive to make it so. <br>
                      <b>Our Model: Connect to Opportunity</b>
                      Young leaders are guided by powerful network along their path to transformative impact in Africa. <br>
                      <b>Our Model: Simulation & Practice</b> 
                      Young leaders complete an intensive program of intellectual growth and hands-on leadership development.

                      ALU is one of the most amazing educational institutions in Africa. It provides access to Education and the capacity needed to be a leader. ALU is not for everyone, it's for the leaders, creators, and dreamers.

                      <h6>Here's what ALU have for you:</h6>
                      We believe that young people hold the potential to become the ethical, entrepreneurial leaders our continent and planet need. Our role is to unlock that potential through a one-of-a-kind learning experience that gives students the foundation for a lifetime of leading positive change.
                      
                      Students choose ALU because they want hands-on real-world experience led by some of the world’s most innovative educators. They want a place that does not limit their potential with old rules but believes in their capacity to solve Africa’s largest challenges in new ways. They want their time at a university to lead them to a job or even to launch a company. They want to be part of a global network committed to their success.
                      
                      Simply put, they want a university that will prepare them to be the leaders who will transform Africa.

              <p> <b>Part One: Who You Are</b> 
                The admissions process begins with your application. This step requires you to provide basic information, including an overview of your academic history and examples of accomplishments you are proud of. <br>
                <b>Part Two: How You Think</b> These are validated measures of how you think across various dimensions — from creativity and mathematics to written and spoken communications. <br>
                <b>Part Three: What You Have Achieved</b> Finally, we want to learn about your accomplishments both in and out of class.

              <p>
                At Minerva, we focus on the qualifications that truly indicate your future potential and fit.

                Our admissions team looks for academic excellence, as well as your areas of passion and individual achievement. Your past academic performance is a reflection of your persistence and ability to work within a structured academic environment, but we also consider it a composite of your personal attributes and your accomplishments outside of school.
                
                In the admissions process, you will be challenged to demonstrate your intellectual curiosity, individual initiative, and other attributes that correspond to leadership potential, innovative thinking, collaboration, and global citizenship. You must also be capable of handling the rigor of the Minerva curriculum, and have the maturity and desire to navigate diverse cities and cultures.   <br>             
                If you qualify, you will be invited to attend. Unit is that simple. Because Minerva isn’t burdened by the systems — or criteria — that have constrained other institutions for the last century, we have developed a fair, merit-based process that identifies the qualities most necessary for success in today’s complex world. <br>

                    We offer a free weekly general orientation session where we discuss the process of applying to U.S. Colleges and Universities.

                    We have a highly selective membership program which targets students who are academically qualified to study in the U.S. We take them through the Five steps of applying to the most appropriate schools. Students who are admitted to U.S. institutions are then invited to a Pre-Departure Orientation where they can get to learn about the U.S. classroom and society.
                    We coordinate the Opportunity Funds Program to recruit High Achieving, Low Income (HALI) students. We work with them to apply to fully funded programs in the U.S.
                    EducationUSA also proctors examinations for distance learning students of U.S. institutions. <br>

                  <p> 
                    Many determined and talented, low-income students in Nigeria only require financial resources and access to information to better their educational future. 
                    For the 11th year, the United States Embassy in Nigeria seeks to identify academically qualified and highly motivated, low-income students, Senior Secondary 3 (SS3) or 12th-grade students in Nigeria to join the EducationUSA Opportunity Funds Program (OFP). <br>

                    OFP’s mission is to assist talented and determined, low-income students who are good candidates for financial assistance from U.S. colleges and universities but lack the financial resources to cover the up-front cost of obtaining admission. <br>

                    OFP works closely with students through regularly scheduled meetings and seminars to assist them throughout the application process to secure admission and scholarships to attend colleges and universities in the United States. OFP finances the cost of the application process, including registration fees for required standardized examinations, and provides free membership to the U.S. EducationUSA Advising Center for its participants. 
                    OFP expects a sincere commitment from the students to give their energy and time to the program so that they may achieve their dreams of studying in the United States. <br>

                    Applicants are welcome from all the states in Nigeria. However, students must be able to reach our offices in Abuja or Lagos on a monthly basis during the program for full participation. 
                    Participants will work with our EducationUSA Advisors from June 2022 to August 2023 to try to secure places and financial assistance to begin studying in the U.S. in August 2023.
                    <br>   
                    Opportunity Funds Program opens on April 1, 2022 for both undergraduate and graduate students. OFP seeks to continue recruiting High Achieving Low Income student. Apply today! <br>

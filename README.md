              Intellect Africa seeks to serve as information gateway to high
              school students in Africa. Before the conception of this project,
              I realized how difficult getting the right information might be.
              Thanks to Tioluwanimofe Adesanya who had worked together with me
              on the project.
              
              Since 2006, the US consulate in Nigeria have been accepting
              students in the country into the Opportunity Funds Program to
              assist low income and high achieving students fufil their dream of
              studying in the United States. However, many low income student
              with brilliant abilities are ignorant about the opportunity.
              
              I was privileged to be accepted into the program in 2020 as an
              undergraduate scholar. Although this was a great opportunity, I
              wasn't prepared for it. Applying to the United States requires
              having a list of active participation in extracurriculars apart
              from your academic standing. Being a student from a sub-urban
              center in Southern Abeokuta, Ideal Comprehensive College, leaves
              me with merger information on extracurriculars I could participate
              in outside of my school. The journey of applying to the US brought
              unexhaustive list of extracurriculars I could participate in while
              at home and why they are important. It is one thing to know you
              can do this and it is another to know why you're doing it. Thanks
              to the supportive EducationUSA Lagos community all the way.
              
              I look forward to a growing community of scholars at Intellect
              Africa.

              Intellect Africa seeks to serve as information gateway to high
              school students in Africa. Before the conception of this project,
              our research showed how difficult getting the right information might be.
              Thanks to the Intellect Africa community who worked together on this project.

              Since 2006, the US consulate in Nigeria have been accepting
              students in the country into the Opportunity Funds Program to
              assist low income and high achieving students fufil their dream of
              studying in the United States. However, many low income student
              with brilliant abilities are ignorant about the opportunity. 
              
              A member of the team was privileged to be accepted into the program in 2020 as an
              undergraduate OFP scholar. With our endless team effort we understood that applying to 
              the United States requires having a list of active participation in extracurriculars apart
              from a regular academic standing. So we set out to make even a student from a sub-urban
              center in Nigera, enabled to take on the journey by providing  
              Quality information on extracurriculars he or she can be able to participate
              outside of their school. 
                
              Intellect Africa brings an unexhaustive list of extracurriculars anyone can participate in while
              at home and why they are important. It is one thing to know you
              can do this and it is another to know why you're doing it. 
              Thanks to the supportive Intellect Africa community all the way. 
              We look forward to a growing community of scholars at Intellect
              Africa.
